# Clustering-analysis
Healthcare Diagnosis


**Objective:** The objective of this analysis is to identify countries in need of aid based on various socio-economic indicators such as child mortality, income, and gross domestic product (GDP).

**Analysis Steps:**
1. **Data Import and Exploration:** The analysis began by importing necessary libraries and reading the data from the 'Country-data.csv' file. The dataset contains information about various countries, including features like child mortality, exports, health expenditure, income, inflation, life expectancy, total fertility rate, and GDP.

2. **Data Visualization:** Initial data exploration involved creating scatter plots and pair plots to visualize the relationships between different features and to get a sense of the data's distribution. Descriptive statistics were also computed to understand the basic characteristics of the dataset.

3. **Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing steps included scaling certain columns to bring them to a common scale and handling outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method. Outliers were replaced with values within the lower and upper whiskers of the boxplots for each feature.

4. **Clustering using K-Means:** The K-Means clustering algorithm was applied to the preprocessed dataset to group countries into clusters based on their socio-economic indicators. The Elbow Method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters, and K=3 was chosen as the number of clusters.

5. **Cluster Analysis:** The countries were clustered into three groups, and cluster analysis was performed to understand the characteristics of each cluster. The clusters were visualized using bar plots to compare the mean values of GDP, child mortality, and income for each cluster.

6. **Identification of Underdeveloped Countries:** To identify countries in need of aid, a specific cluster (Cluster 1) was analyzed. Cluster 1 exhibited high child mortality, low GDP, and low income. Further filtering was applied to identify countries with extremely low GDP and high child mortality.

**Results:**
- Cluster 1, which is characterized by high child mortality, low GDP, and low income, consists of 48 countries.
- A subset of countries within Cluster 1 (e.g., Afghanistan, Benin, Burkina Faso, etc.) exhibits extremely low GDP and high child mortality. These countries are considered as the most underdeveloped and in need of immediate aid.

**Recommendations:**
Based on the analysis, we recommend that stakeholders focus their aid efforts on the subset of countries within Cluster 1, which have the highest child mortality rates, lowest GDP, and income. These countries are in urgent need of support to improve the well-being of their populations, reduce child mortality, and boost economic development.

**Conclusion:**
The analysis has successfully identified and categorized countries based on their socio-economic indicators, helping stakeholders prioritize aid efforts. By concentrating efforts on the most underdeveloped countries within Cluster 1, we can work towards improving living conditions, reducing child mortality, and fostering economic growth in these nations.
